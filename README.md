This is made to be the second version of my previous pathfinding project made with C++ igraphics. But then added some more visualizations too.  

So far there are 6 segments  
- Pathfinder
- Prime Numbers
- Sorting Algorithms
- N Queen
- Convex Hull
- Recursion Tree

## Algorithms implemented 

- DFS
- BFS
- Dijkstra
- A star
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Heap sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- N Queen Backtracking
- Graham Scan for Convex Hull
- Recursion
  - Fibonacci Number
  - Binomial Coefficient
